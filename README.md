# Ocular Disease Detection - Image Recognition
Ocular disease image detection using neural networks.

----------- This project is under development -----------

The purpose of this project is to detect ocular diseases using image recognition. The objective is to create a Neural Network model that can identify between different diseases in fundus eye images.  

The Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and is a structured ophthalmic database of 5,000 patients with age, color fundus photographs from left and right eyes and doctors' diagnostic keywords from doctors, collected by Shanggong Medical Technology Co., Ltd. from different hospitals/medical centers in China.

Images are classified in eight labels including:
- Normal (N),
- Diabetes (D),
- Glaucoma (G),
- Cataract (C),
- Age related Macular Degeneration (A),
- Hypertension (H),
- Pathological Myopia (M),
- Other diseases/abnormalities (O)
